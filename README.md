Abstract
The time delay elements in conventional chemical mine detonators comprise pyrotechnic compositions pressed in aluminium or ceramic tubes. Traditional formulations are not ideal; they contain heavy metals which are bio accumulative and toxic to the environment. It is therefore important to investigate alternative metals that are environmentally friendly and not a safety hazard. This study investigates the potential for Zirconium fuel with the Oxide Mixtures CuO, Fe_2 O_3 and WO_3 as pyrotechnic compositions. To do these simulations were run varying the fuel content in the mixture to predict the viability of these compositions. This led to the conclusion that Zr- CuO and Fe_2 O_3  is viable at a fuel content of 38 wt-% and 46 wt-% respectively. It is unlikely that Zr- WO_3 is viable due to the very high adiabatic temperature of 3818 ̊C that is above the melting point of often used tube materials like ceramic and aluminium.

Introduction
Background
Time delay refers to the delay, measured in milliseconds to seconds, between the initial ignition and the activation of the explosive charge. It is a necessary function in the application of mining detonators. Mining detonators are devices that initiate the explosion of high explosives. This allows the use of staggered detonations, which improve rock breakage, reduce seismic impact, and enhance safety by preventing overlap of blast waves (McLain, 1980). This means that precise control is achieved by perfectly choosing the time delay of each detonator.
There are two types of time delay detonators: pyrotechnic (chemical) and electronic. Both types present their own advantages and disadvantages. Electronic detonators allow extremely precise control over the set delay time but are relatively expensive. Pyrotechnic delay detonators however are simple, rugged, and low cost for high volume mining applications due to their dependence on the properties of the specific chemical composition within the delay detonator (Conkling, 2000). Depending on the specific chemical used for the composite can also present an environmental or health risk. The delay is usually experimentally determined. It is desirable to know the burn rate of various possible pyrotechnic delay composition to achieve precise adjustable delay.
Figure 1 shows, a schematic of a typical pyrotechnic time delay detonator. The delay element itself consists of a tube made from metal or other high melting point material that holds the compressed delay composition. 
                 Figure 1: Schematic of a pyrotechnic delay detonator from Guo et al. (2020).

These compositions consist of a well-mixed fuel and oxidizer that are capable of a highly exothermic, self‐sustaining reaction they are packed into a small diameter tube (Focke et al., 2019). On combustion, a metal oxide is reduced to its metal state by a less noble metallic fuel that, in turn, is converted into a more stable metal oxide.
 It is also important that the reaction results in a product or products with no more than 10 mL of gaseous products per gram of mixture. In other words, the reaction must be considered a low-gas pyrotechnic mixture (Dolgoborodov et al., 2022).This assures that the reaction can successfully propagate with consistent predictable burn rates. This is because gas products cause instability and unpredictability.   The observed time delay is determined by the nature of the reagents, the mixing ratio of reactants, the dimensions of the column and the properties of the material that the tube consist of. 
One possible drawback of pyrotechnic delay compositions is the possible presence of an environmental or health risk as mentioned previously. Due to environmental and safety legislation, it is important to use compound that do not pose a health or environmental risk.  The less toxic heavy metals include copper, iron, tin, tungsten, zinc and bismuth (Sabatini, 2014). For the time being, commercial mine detonators continue to rely on heavy metal‐based pyrotechnic time delays. These include heavy‐metal‐based oxidizers, e.g., lead oxides, barium sulphate, or chromates (Tchounwou et al., 2012). This is because greener, cost‐effective alternatives remain elusive.
In a recent study Brotman et al., (2021) a theoretical model was used to determine the burn rates of the various combinations of Al, Zr, B/CuO, Fe2O3, WO3, and Pb3O4. The model is designed as an open system of a one-dimensional chain of identical cells where each elemental cell is populated according to the theoretical maximum density percentage (%TMD). Each cell represents a single fuel-oxidizer pairs. %TMD is the ratio between the particles’ volume and the total cell volume. A contact angle θ fixed at 135° is chosen to represent the degree of coalescence of the two adjacent spherical fuel and oxidizer particles before combustion starts. This value was observed for usual experimental conditions in for the various composites. 









A constant power density is applied at the first cell until initiation. The system is considered initiated once the runaway exothermic reaction takes place. The reaction is simulated using a diffusion-reaction scheme, which allows the calculation of the combustion kinetics of the various species. A fundamental assumption and limitation of the model is that the chemistry driving the thermite combustion is restricted to a purely condensed phase process. The model is based on the one-dimensional oxygen flux along the x direction that obeys the general form:
ϕ(x)=-D∙S(x)∙(dC(x))/dx
The D represents the temperature dependent diffusion coefficient (mol.m−3), the C(x) represents the temperature dependent concentration (mol.m−3) and the S(x) represents the surface area of the interface.
These results however are purely theoretical, and it is unknown if they are realistic prediction of burn rats in use. There are extensive studies to determine the burn rate of both Al- and B-fuel based compositions, and the study makes use of these to compare their theoretical results to the experimental findings. (Fischer and Grubelich, 1998) This is because factors such particle size and interaction production of byproducts and heat loss can all affect the burn rate according to Focke et al., (2019). To account for this the theoretical model is compared to experimental results. The paper noted that regarding Zirconium-Based thermites there are currently no explicit studies on their reaction characteristics. Zirconium is considered to not be an environmental and health hazard which adds to its viability. (Paradis and Rhim, 1999)
Problem statement
There are no explicit studies on the reaction characteristics, thermodynamics and burning rate of Zirconium-based systems.  To confirm the burn rate that a previous study found with a theoretical model experimental burn rate tests can be conducted on this composite.











Aim and objectives
The aim is to evaluate the viability of three different Zirconium-based fuel compositions as possible pyrotechnical delay compositions in mining detonators. The focus will be on the thermodynamic behavior, reaction product and burn rate of the composites.
The objectives to achieve this goal are listed below:
	Complete an EKVI-thermodynamic simulation for each composite.
	Prepare the composites by mixing and packing in tubes.
	Burning rate analysis.
	 Characterization of the composites.









Method and scope
EKVI-Thermodynamic Simulation
Thermochemical simulations will be carried out using the EKVI Release 4.30 thermodynamics software. The purpose of such simulation is to analyse the effect of mixture composition on the adiabatic reaction temperature. The adiabatic reaction temperature is a thermodynamic parameter that describes the temperature to which the product is raised under adiabatic conditions due to the evolution of heat from the reaction itself. Observation of this parameter will allow us to determine if the reaction will be self-sustaining. Reactions are usually self-sustaining if the adiabatic reaction temperature is above 1000 ̊C. EKVI-Simulation also allows the observance of the product spectrum and the phase fractions, expected at the variety of compositions. It can therefore be determined if the products are below 10 mL of gaseous products per gram of mixture to assure that the products are gasless. 
Materials
The following materials are needed:
	Zr powder
	CuO
	Fe2O3
	WO3
The particle size and density should be noted because these characteristics can affect burn rates. They are dependent on the availability of each chemical.
Preparation Methods
Binary mixtures will be prepared by combining the Zirconium with each oxidizer. The mixtures will be combined in different proportions which are determined by analysing the EKVI-Simulation results. The compositions will be prepared by a brush-mixing technique. Weighed‐out reagent quantities will be combined and repeatedly brushed through a 45 μm sieve. 
The well‐mixed formulations should then be loaded into 50‐mm‐long borosilicate glass tubes with inside and outside diameters of 6.0 mm and 8.0 mm, respectively. The tubes will then be closed at one end using a small portion of Prestik putty. Small increments of the mixed powders will be dispensed into the tubes. The loaded powder portion will be consolidated, by repeated tapping, before adding the next increment. Samples to  be  burned in lead tubes can be  prepared in a similar fashion. (Guo et al., 2020)
Burning Rate Measurements
Two types of burn test will be conducted. The open-air burn test and the burn rate measurements on compacted tubes.
Open-air burns will be conducted inside a fume hood. Grooves, 2 mm deep and 4 mm wide will be machined into pyrophyllite blocks. The well-mixed powder will be placed inside these slots and mildly compacted with the assistance of a small spatula. The sample burn length will be set to about 40 mm. A small quantity of the starter composition will be placed at one end and ignited with a butane torch. 
The filled glass tubes will be placed inside other larger glass tubes that served as horizontal holders. The compacted lead tubes can be clamped in a horizontal position. The composition will then be ignited by placing the tip of a sparkler against the one end of the delay element. Ignition will be triggered with an electrical fuse positioned in contact with the starter composition. The burning events will be recorded with a digital camera at a frame rate of 240 Hz. The burning rate will be estimated from the burn time, extracted from the video recording, and the effective burn length. (Montgomery et al., 2017)





Re-creation of Burn rate prediction model
To aid in future burn rate prediction the model discussed in the background can be replicated.
The model exits as a one-dimensional numerical model and was developed to simulate the propagation of thermite reactions based on thermal diffusion and reaction kinetics. Some changes were made to this model in comparation with that of Brotman et al. (2021). The model created in this study adopts a simplified structure to prioritize computational accessibility where Brotman et al. (2021) includes detailed modelling of oxide shell rupture and oxygen diffusion delays. It operates by solving three coupled equations. The Heat equation, diffusion equation and reactant consumption. The combustion front is tracked as the first position where temperature is larger than 1200 K. Burns rate is calculated as the distance travelled by the front divided by the time elapsed, converted to cm/s.
Some assumptions were made for the functionality of the model. This includes that the thermite mixture is homogeneous. This means that we can use constants for the following parameters: density(ρ), specific heat (c_p), thermal conductivity (k), reaction enthalpy (Q), activation energy (E_a) and the pre-exponential factor (A). Another assumption is the use of Arrhenius-type kinetics to model the chemical heat release of the reaction. The model also assumes no gas production even if this is possible in the given compound. 
The model was implemented in Python using the NumPy library for numerical computations and Matplotlib for visualization. Some parameters were chosen for the functionality of the model. The sample length (L = 0.01 m) is divided into N = 201 points with a spatial step of dx = 0.00005 m. The sample within the model stars with a temperature (T₀ = 300 K). To start the propagation of the burn front within the sample an ignition pulse (1500 K) is applied.
The model uses a database to input the necessary physical parameters. Unfortunately, there are few reliable sources for the specific properties necessary. Therefore, the model uses placeholder values where literature values are not available too simply test its ability to calculate an output. With proper physical analysis of a particular compound the model will likely be able to serve as a capable predicter of burn rates. The model does have some limits due to the assumption of a single-step reaction, uniform material properties and neglecting complex phenomena such as phase changes, particle size effects, or multi-step kinetics.
The following table includes the results of the model. They do not reflect reality due to the lack of physical analysis to find realistic properties.





Analysis of EKVI-simulation results
Zr-CuO








The resulting products of the EKVI simulations for the reaction of Zr with CuO is presented in Figure 3. When the fuel composition is varied large changes in the resulting products and the adiabatic flame temperature is observed. For this system a maximum in the adiabatic reaction temperature (2567 ̊C) is reached at a fuel content of 38 wt-%. This is notable because the reaction is only sustainable if the temperature is above 1000 ̊C. The primary termite reaction for the formulation has the following stoichiometry: 〖Zr + 2CuO → ZrO〗_2+2Cu. Therefore, the maximum adiabatic temperature is reached at the expected fuel content predicted by the stoichiometry. 
Below this fuel content decreasing between the range of 0 wt-% and 10 wt-% there is exec unreacted CuO present. Side reactions explain why this range ends at 10 wt-% and does not continue until 38 wt-%. Above the 38 wt-% there is exec unreacted Zr metal present.
Some byproducts are present. The first〖 Cu〗_2 O only occurs in the range 0 wt-% and 30 wt-%. This is the result of the following side reaction 〖Zr + 2CuO → ZrO〗_2+2Cu that occurs only when the CuO content exceeds the Zr content. The second byproduct is a small amount of Cu_2 never above 3 wt-%. This is simply an additional reaction that happens at the high adiabatic temperatures 〖2Cu → Cu〗_2. The last compound present in noticeable quantities is O_2. Never exceeding 5 wt-%. It occurs in the region where CuO exceeds the stoichiometric ideal for the primary reaction and is below the stoichiometric ideal of the secondary reaction. There are execs oxygen molecules presents which bond together and enter the gaseous phase.
A noteworthy feature of the system is that the adiabatic flame temperature shows a plateau value in the composition range 38 wt-% to 72 wt-% fuel. This is attributed to the exothermic formation of a zirconium copper intermetallic compounds. The compound is transitional, so it is not listed as a product.








The important thing to notice is that the phases correspond roughly to the adiabatic temperature. At high temperatures there is more gas and liquid and almost no solids. A notable observation is that in the range of 38 wt-% and 62 wt-% there are fluctuations in the gas and liquid phase fractions. This is due to one of the present products the Cu boiling point being 2562 ̊C which is just slightly below the maximum adiabatic reaction temperature of the system (2567 ̊C). Therefore, Cu fluctuates between different amounts of liquid and vapour wt-%. The most important observation is however that there is a minimal amount of gas present at the stoichiometric ideal of 38 wt-%. This is ideal because we desire gasless time delay compositions.
〖Zr-Fe〗_2 O_3








The resulting products of the EKVI simulations for the reaction of Zr with Fe_2 O_3 is presented in Figure 5. Changes in the resulting products and the adiabatic flame temperature is observed When the fuel composition is varied large. For this system a maximum in the adiabatic reaction temperature (2870 ̊C) is reached at a fuel content of 46 wt-%. This is notable because the reaction is only sustainable if the temperature is above 1000 ̊C. The primary termite reaction for the formulation has the following stoichiometry: 3〖〖Zr + 2Fe〗_2 O_3  → 3ZrO〗_2+4Fe. Therefore, the maximum adiabatic temperature is reached at the expected fuel content predicted by the stoichiometry. 
Below this fuel content decreasing between the range of 0 wt-% and 10 wt-% there is exec unreacted Fe_2 O_3  present. Side reactions explain why this range ends at 10 wt-% and does not continue until 46 wt-%. Above the 46 wt-% there is exec unreacted Zr metal present.
Regarding byproducts many are present. In the range 0 wt-% and 20 wt-% the byproduct 〖 Fe〗_3 O_4  is observed. This is due to the following secondary reaction  〖〖Zr + 6Fe〗_2 O_3  → ZrO〗_2+〖 4Fe〗_3 O_4. This reaction occurs due to the low amount of Zr-feul present. Therefore, only very few oxygen molecules are transferred. In the range 8 wt-% and 48 wt-% the byproduct FeO is observed. This is due to the following secondary reaction  〖〖Zr + Fe〗_2 O_3  → ZrO〗_2+FeO+Fe. This reaction occurs due to low fuel content. The complex metal oxide Fe·86O forms at a single point in the fuel deprived region at 20 wt-%. Additional unreacted oxygen re-bonds to a single metal molecule according to this reaction 2〖〖Zr + 30Fe〗_2 O_3  → 2ZrO〗_2+Fe·86O.  The simulation indicated that ZrO is a possible product but at no point does the reaction conditions meat the necessary conditions for its formation. The compounds O,O_2 and O_3 can form at low fuel content conditions but the simulation predicts none of them will form due to the high temperatures present.
A noteworthy feature of the system is that the adiabatic flame temperature shows a plateau value in the composition range 46 wt-% to 56 wt-% fuel. This is attributed to the exothermic formation of a zirconium iron intermetallic compounds.









The phases present correspond roughly to the adiabatic temperature. At high temperatures there is more liquid and almost no solids. A notable observation is that in the range of 38 wt-% and 64 wt-% there is only a liquid phase present. A very important observation however is that there is almost no gas present throughout the range of fuel compositions. A small amount off gas results only at one data point 46 wt-% Zr. This is at the stoichiometric ideal composition. 
Zr-〖WO〗_3









The resulting products of the EKVI simulations for the reaction of Zr with WO_3 is presented in Figure 7. The most notable characteristic is of this reaction is that there is a large amount possible products. Changes in the resulting products and the adiabatic flame temperature is observed when the fuel composition is varied large. For this system a maximum in the adiabatic reaction temperature (3818 ̊C) is reached at a fuel content of 36 wt-%. The primary termite reaction for the formulation has the following stoichiometry: 3Zr+2WO_3  →2W+3ZrO_3. Therefore, the maximum adiabatic temperature is reached before the expected fuel content predicted by the stoichiometry at 40 wt-%. The adiabatic temperature here is 3572 ̊C. This temperature is very high and presents as a challenge in delay composition applications due to the it exceeding the melting point of common tube materials (e.g. Ceramic and Aluminium). 
Below this fuel content decreasing between the range of 0 wt-% and 8 wt-% there is exec unreacted  WO_3  present. Secondary reactions explain why this range ends at 8 wt-% and does not continue until 40 wt-%. Above the 40 wt-% there is exec unreacted Zr metal present.
There are many byproducts present. We will first discuss the byproducts present in the fuel rich region. This will be between the range 40 wt-% and 100 wt-%. Here only one secondary reaction is present. It happens when an exec of Zr-fuel and a very large adiabatic temperature is present at 45 wt%. The following secondary reaction also occurs here: 3Zr+WO_3  →W+3ZrO.
Seven different tungsten oxides are possible products. To analyse the products found in the oxygen rich region a separate graph was generated between 0 wt% and 40 wt%. 









The first interesting thing to note is that if more fuel is present in the system, then the tungsten oxides that form include less oxygen.  The following table lists the seven tungsten-oxides, what fuel content ranges they can occur and the reaction responsible for their formation. The oxidant to fuel ratio is indicated in the table. The larger this ratio is the more to the left of the graph it occurs. 
The tungsten-oxides can be sorted into two groups. The first are unique secondary redox reactions that occur due to excess oxygen being present, the second are reformation reactions that occur where exec oxidant and large adiabatic temperature (thus a lot of energy) are present. The excess tungsten oxide reforms and the three compounds at the end of the table are formed.


Range	Compound	Reaction	Ratio
0 wt-% to 6 wt-%	W_25 O_74	Zr+50WO_3  →ZrO_3+〖2W〗_25 O_74	50
0 wt-% to 14 wt-%	W_18 O_49	5Zr+36WO_3  →5ZrO_3+〖2W〗_18 O_49	7.2
15 wt-% to 40 wt-%	W_3 O_8	2Zr+6WO_3  →2ZrO_3+W_3 O_8	6
4 wt-% to 16 wt-%	WO_2	Zr+2WO_3  →ZrO_2+2WO_2	2

16 wt-% to 40 wt-%	W_4 O_12	4WO_3  → W_4 O_12	N/A
16 wt-% to 40 wt-%	W_3 O_9	3WO_3  → W_3 O_9	N/A
16 wt-% to 40 wt-%	W_2 O_6	2WO_3  → W_2 O_6	N/A

The compounds O,O_2 and O_3 can form at low fuel content conditions but the simulation predicts none of them will form due to the high temperatures present. A noteworthy feature of the system is that the adiabatic flame temperature shows a plateau value in the composition range 40 wt-% to 50 wt-% fuel. This is attributed to the exothermic formation of a transitional zirconium-tungsten intermetallic compounds.










The phases present correspond roughly to the adiabatic temperature. At high temperatures there is more liquid and gas and almost no solids. Due to the high adiabatic temperatures much more gas is present at the oxidant rich area because the tungsten oxides have a low boiling point. A notable observation is that in the range of 40 wt-% and 50 wt-% there is only a liquid phase present. A very important observation however is that there is almost no gas present at the stoichiometric ideal of 40 wt% fuel. This is ideal for gasless time delay compositions.
	





Results and Discussion
The viability of the three different composites in the use of pyrotechnic time delay elements were evaluated in this study.  Another conclusion that can be made from the simulation results is the expected side byproducts of the composites.
The first composite Zr - CuO is concluded to be viable. At an adiabatic reaction temperature of 2567 ̊C is reached at a fuel content of 38 wt-%. This is the ideal expected conditions. They are also viable. The temperature is above 1000 ̊C which is an estimate that means it will be self-sustainable. Figure 4 allows us to conclude that the reaction will also result in gasless products which is a requirement for time delay composites.
The second composite 〖Zr-Fe〗_2 O_3 is likely to be viable. At an adiabatic reaction temperature of 2870 ̊C is reached at a fuel content of 46 wt-%. This is the ideal expected conditions. They are also viable. The temperature is above 1000 ̊C which is an estimate that means it will be self-sustainable. Figure 6 allows us to conclude that the reaction will also result in gasless products which is a requirement for time delay composites.
The last composite Zr-WO_3 is unlikely to be viable. The expected adiabatic reaction temperature of 3818 ̊C is reached at a fuel content of 36 wt-%. This is our expected ideal conditions. The temperature is above 1000 ̊C which is an estimate that means it will be self-sustainable. Unfortunately, the expected adiabatic temperature is above the melting point of often used tube materials like ceramic and aluminium. This means premature failure is likely and thus this composite is unusable.
